# Smoke-Fluid-Dynamics

### Hello! 👋  This is my Final Year Project created at University

# Code
All CFD code can be found here:
[Here](https://github.com/lukewhitingdev/Smoke-Fluid-Dynamics/tree/main/FluidDynamics/Core/Components/CFD/Grid) <br>
All Grid Generation code can be found here:

# Controls
WSAD - Move Camera Position
Right-Click-Hold - Move Camera LookAt (Sometimes snaps aplogies)

# Notes
Currently quite un-optimized and slow so run at your own risk. 2D simulations run fairly well, 3D takes a large performance hit however. <br>
Based upon Jos Stam's paper: Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games
