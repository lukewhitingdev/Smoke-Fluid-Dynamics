# Smoke-Fluid-Dynamics

## Hello! This is my Final Year Project created at University

# Controls
WSAD - Move Camera Position
Right-Click-Hold - Move Camera LookAt (Sometimes snaps aplogies)

# Notes
Currently quite un-optimized and slow so run at your own risk. 2D simulations run fairly well, 3D takes a large performance hit however. <br>
Based upon Jos Stam's paper: Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games
